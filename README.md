## ☀️ Menty
Here to take care and improve your mental health


## 🤔 Project BackGround
- Due to the pandemic, lots of people, especially students, are required to stay at home.
- Since there are no on-campus class, meeting with peers, friends and other people except for family members, some people might felt depressed, lonely, stressed or any other negative feelings.


## 💭 About Menty
Menty is an web application build to improve or maintain one’s mental health by setting simple tasks and goals for them. We hope to help users to build a positive mindset in these tough times.


## ⚙️ How it works
- Menty provides users up to 3 different tasks everyday. These tasks are usually easy to complete, for example be grateful about one thing today or do an exercise. There is also a leaderboard so that users could encourage each other to complete more tasks.

- Whenever a user open the page and presses the start button, the page will scoll down and, showing two columns which are a list of tasks and a leaderboard. User can click on the corresponding button whenever they finish the positive act given, and the score will be added and updated. 

## Build with
Django, Html, CSS, Javascript
