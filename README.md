## ☀️ Menty
Here to take care and improve your mental health


## 🤔 Project Background
- Due to the pandemic, many people, especially students, must stay at home.
- Since there are no on-campus classes, or meetings with peers, friends, and other people except for family members, some people might feel depressed, lonely, stressed, or any other negative feelings.


## 💭 About Menty
Menty is a web application built to improve or maintain one’s mental health by setting simple tasks and goals for them. We hope to help users to build a positive mindset in these tough times.


## ⚙️ How it works
- Menty provides users with up to 3 different tasks every day. These tasks are usually easy to complete, for example, be grateful about one thing today or do an exercise. There is also a leaderboard so users can encourage each other to complete more tasks.

- Whenever a user opens the page and presses the start button, the page will scoll down and show two columns: a list of tasks and a leaderboard. Users can click on the corresponding button whenever they finish the positive act given, and the score will be added and updated. 

## Build with
Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript
